Its messages will be prefixed with\n        'in'.\n    out_socket : Socket\n        One of the sockets to the Queue. Its messages will be prefixed with\n        'out'. The only difference between in/out socket is this prefix.\n    mon_socket : Socket\n        This socket sends out every message received by each of the others\n        with an in/out prefix specifying which one it was.\n    in_prefix : str\n        Prefix added to broadcast messages from in_socket.\n    out_prefix : str\n        Prefix added to broadcast messages from out_socket.\n    "
